      <p>I’m Lucas, a 27-year-old Brazilian living a busy and curious life. I work as a Salesforce administrator and enjoy building and experimenting with technology, from Apex refactoring to designing personal projects like a quotes app. I’m also diving into Express and MongoDB for personal finance APIs. Outside tech, I work at Vicenzo Pizzeria, hit the gym five times a week, and keep learning through hands-on challenges. I’m preparing to move to Dublin, where I’m learning Irish expressions and accents while exploring politics, culture, and literature. Science, fantasy, and travel are my main sources of inspiration and curiosity.</p>
      <h3>Brazil</h3>
      <img src="images/image2.png" alt="Brazil flag">
      <p>Brazil is South America’s largest country, rich in culture, landscapes, and ecosystems. The Amazon Rainforest, the world’s largest tropical forest, where I was born, covers about 40% of Brazil’s territory, with nearly 60% of the entire rainforest lying inside Brazil. It is a cradle of biodiversity and a vital regulator of Earth’s climate. Alongside it once stood the Atlantic Forest, stretching along Brazil’s coast; today, less than 15% of its original area remains due to centuries of deforestation. Despite these challenges, Brazil’s natural and cultural diversity—from vibrant cities to unique ecosystems—remains one of the country’s greatest treasures, shaping its beauty and global identity.</p>
